## Description

This example runs Python packages that uses native extension, you can see a guide [here](https://github.com/graalvm/graal-languages-demos/blob/main/graalpy/graalpy-native-extensions-guide/README.md), 
this application takes a text entry passed to the Java main method as an argument and then pass it the OPENAI API using GraalPy,
the code in this example is pretty much the code in the [official OPENAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/create-and-export-an-api-key).
check the [implementation details](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/create-and-export-an-api-key)

However the implementations details in short are the following, the Python code that is embedded in Java has to return a function
which then is mapped using a Java interface

## Development Environment Requirements

As you can see the guide indicate the requirements are:

* An IDE or text editor, I used IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 ultimate edition
* A supported JDK, preferably the latest GraalVM JDK, I used Oracle GraalVM Java-21
* a C compiler toolchain (e.g., GCC, cargo)

## Development Environment Set up

### Using Gradle

1. [Install gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)


2. Initialize a gradle project either using IntelliJ or the [documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/part1_gradle_init.html),
you should use gradle wrapper, this would make it easier for other users running your code


3. Configure your project's gradle file, 

### Using Maven
If you need here is a [Maven cheat sheet](https://medium.com/@TimvanBaarsen/maven-cheat-sheet-45942d8c0b86)

1. [download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven


2. Start a project [using GraalPy's Maven archetype](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/python/#maven) or using IntelliJ, you might want to match the configurations in the pom.xml file 
generated when using the archetype.

3. To be able to execute Java applications from the CLI without packing the app in a JAR file add the group: "org.codehaus.mojo" 
artifact: "exec-maven-plugin" plugin, make sure to declare the right main class package, however be aware that it is possible to run apps 
in CLI using Maven without this plugin so you could skip it if you want

### Add GraalPy Dependencies
As described in [GraalPy Getting Started documentation](https://www.graalvm.org/python/#getting-started), we will also 
add a plugin that will allow us to import Python packages as if we were using `pip install` command

#### Using Maven

```xml
<project>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.graalvm.polyglot</groupId>
          <artifactId>polyglot</artifactId> 
          <version>24.1.1</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.graalvm.polyglot</groupId>
          <artifactId>python</artifactId> 
          <version>24.1.1</version>
          <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.graalvm.python</groupId>
                <artifactId>graalpy-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>24.1.1</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <configuration>
                            <packages>
                                <!-- Select Python packages to install via pip. -->
                                <package>pyfiglet==1.0.2</package>
                            </packages>
                        </configuration>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>process-graalpy-resources</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

#### Using Gradle
In the project's gradle file:

 ```kts
plugins {
    id("java")          // java apps needs this
    id("application")   // to be able to run app in CLI
    id("org.graalvm.python") version "24.1.1"
}

graalPy {
    // collection of python packages
    packages = setOf("pyfiglet==1.0.2")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.graalvm.polyglot:polyglot:24.1.1")
    implementation("org.graalvm.polyglot:python:24.1.1")
}
 ```
### Using Python Packages That Use Native Extensions
It was indicated in the requirements that a C compiler is needed, in my case I will show how to set up GCC in Windows either
by using the WSL or , I did it on Windows 11 build 22631.4460.

#### Using WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)
1. Install WSL. Checkout the [installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). However, all the commands you may need
are the bellow, alternatively you can download "Ubuntu" app from "Microsoft Store" and just run so Ubuntu WSL is installed on
your computer, set up your user name and password from there.

```bash
  wsl install # enables/set up all features necessary to run WSL
  wsl install -d <distro_name>  # installs the indicated distro
  wsl --list --online # returns a list of valid distributions that can be installed
  wsl -l -v # shows a list of installed distributions with its version
  wsl -d <distro_name> # run the indicated distribution
  wsl --terminate <distro_name> # terminates indicated distro
  wsl --shutdown  # terminates all running distributions and the WSL2 lightweight utility virtual machine
```

2. You can share Windows environment variables using [WSLENV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems#share-environment-variables-between-windows-and-wsl-with-wslenv) 
this will enable you to call the variable from both operating systems, if it points to an executable you could run commands using that executable, but 
the limitation in our case is that when running our code from IntelliJ using the "remote development"/"connect to WSL" option
the JDK won't be recognized by the IDE, and as stated in [IntelliJÂ´s instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/how-to-use-wsl-development-environment-in-product.html#create_project_for_wsl)
we need to install the JDK in our linux distro. meaning in this case sharing a variable won't be good enough. So [Install GraalVm](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/getting-started/linux/), the easiest way to 
do this is using SDKMAN, just make sure to install all other utilities SDKMAN needs to run. If you choose to do it manually after you
unzip the file make sure you set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly, this can be done either in `etc/environmet` file which
sets the variable accross all users, or either in `.profile` or `.bashrc` files, both located inside `/home/<user>` directory. I
used SDKMAN
